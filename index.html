                <h2>A brief intro</h2>
                <p>If I have to set up links to repositories I own and social media, I might as well talk about my self. Except, I'm bored, and I don't want to talk about myself, so here's a paragraph with a long and convoluted copypasta.</p>
                <p>The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</p>

                <p>This is an example of an image used as part of CSS in order to make something that doesn't look terrible. If there's one thing I can't stand it's a janky website that looks like it was made circa 1995. I refuse to stoop low enough to make one. </p>
                <p>Also, just to cover my bases and explain what this image is, have a brief description from the product website:</p>
                <p>Compiling and updating monsters that originally appeared in previous Wizards of the Coast products for 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons, this book presents friends and foes for any D&D campaign.</p>
                <hr>
                <ul>
                <li>Includes over 250 monsters. Updates to the monsters include making spellcasters easier for Dungeon Masters to run; giving many monsters more damage and resilience; and improving the organization of the stat blocks themselves.</li>
                <li>Includes over 30 playable races. Brings all previously printed setting-agnostic races into one book, complementing the races in the <em>Player's Handbook.</em></li>
                <li>A multiverse of lore. Includes updates to monster lore that refocuses the stories on the D&D multiverse, rather than on any particular world.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>On the Cover</strong><br>
